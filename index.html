                    <p>From the time series area chart below we can see that over time the trend of terrorist attacks is upwards. I would say that there seems to be almost a cyclical pattern forming but would need to wait for future data to confirm this structure. </p>
                    <p>I've annotated the point 2001 as that marks the infamous 9/11 attack that devastated the world globally. It's interesting to note that the few years after 2001, attacks spiked upwards, perhaps as a result of this event. I've also annotated 2014 which marks the highest activity of terrorist attacks, and the infamous Lindt Cafe Siege in Sydney. I remember that holiday season I was living in Sydney and there was genuine fear as most people assumed we were safe from such attacks.</p>

It's nice to notice that Australia is on the lower end of the scale however alarming just North, Indonesia is on the higher end. Geographically, Australia is surrounded by other islands like itself, and an assumption can be made from this map that islands are less likely to experience terrorist attacks than inland countries.</p> <p>I don't think any assumption can be made about which regions experience more attacks as it seems to be relatively dangerous countries in every region (perhaps Asia is more prone). </p>

                    <p>As suspected, Australia does have a higher number of wounded people then number of people killed, as a result of terrorist attacks. Comparatively, Australia isn't as safe as it's surrounding countries. A country often compared to Australia, New Zealand is much safer in terms of both kills and wounded (with 1 and 2 respectively). Australia has had 23 people killed as a result of terrorist attacks and 113 wounded. </p>
                    <p>Malaysia, surprisingly has had more people killed then wounded. This is very alarming as if a terrorist attack where to happen, a person would be more likely to die then be wounded statistically.</p>

                    <p>I thought with the social justice revolution taking place globally, having originated from USA, it would be interesting to see the language used in reports written about the terrorist attacks in USA during the 1970s.</p>
                    <p>It's interesting to note that words such as "Black" and "African" are used in relation to terrorism so often. This is reflective of the racial discrimination that is still apparent in USA against African Americans. </p>
                    <p>Some interesting words that intrigued me was "school" and "panther". School shootings are still terrorist attacks that occur frequently in USA today. I researched why panther was mentioned and to my surprise it was in relation to the now famous superhero Black Panther. The Black Panther Party was a famous racial justice  group that was often accused of terrorist attack (which was false). It's interesting to note that the US government has still recorded these acts of terrorism. </p>

                    <p> Bombing private citizens and property has proven to be the deadliest attack and target type combination globally. I investigated this type combination and found a number of cases that occurred in Iraq where bombs where hidden in cars or shopping centers which resulted in killing a large number of private (innocent) citizens. This explains the above report on Iraq suffering from a high number of people killed even with such a small population.
